# SPACE TRAVELER 
#### Video game made using curses & asyncio asyncio

### How to install?

I use pipenv package to work with virtual environment so you need to install it first
`pip3 install pipenv `

Create .env file and place this code:

```
TIC_TIMEOUT=0.1
STARS_DIGITS=+, *, ., :
STARS_COUNT=100
ANIMATIONS_PATH=anim_frames/rocket
```

And then make 3 to: create VE -> go inside -> run script

- `pipenv install `

- `pipenv shell`

- `python3 main.py`
